# Library
A library app showing you the books you have read and not read yet.

This design is inspired by github user @https://github.com/michalosman's take on his library app on the Odin Project.

This project represents a project that is crucial in my beginner learning.

Features coming in the next update

-Ability to confirm deletion of book

- Ability to log in and save the books you add.
