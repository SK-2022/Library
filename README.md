# Library
A library app showing you the books you have read and not read yet.

This design is inspired by github user @https://github.com/michalosman's take on his library app on the Odin Project.

This project represents a project that is crucial in my beginner learning. It will also serve as a point of referrence for card making in css.

I will return to this in late October
